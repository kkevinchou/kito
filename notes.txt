BUGS

Pathfinding where two polys share a vertex but have no portal.  Pathfinding will find a path but smoothing will fail (i think?).
Need to decide whether moving along a single vertex is allowed.
Renderer is shared between asset manager and render system atm, may want to isolate it in one place.
