CONTEXT

cleaning up camera perspective rendering code and ray casting.  looks like i don't need
to store the MV matrix in the camera each rendering frame FacePalm

TODO

Move all opengl related calls to a single package
Decide whether moving along a single vertex is allowed

BUGS

Pathfinding where two polys share a vertex but have no portal.  Pathfinding will find a path but smoothing will fail (i think?).
Renderer is shared between asset manager and render system atm, may wkito to isolate it in one place.
