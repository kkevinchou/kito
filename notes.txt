CONTEXT

cleaning up camera perspective rendering code and ray casting.  looks like i don't need
to store the MV matrix in the camera each rendering frame FacePalm
shadowmapping only exists for basicshadow shaders. should make this more modular so that it can be imported into many shaders

TODO

Decide whether moving along a single vertex is allowed
max speed currently isn't used in physics component
networking :D
bake navmesh polygon normals into nav mesh polygons. in general make then more rich than just plain polygons

BUGS

Pathfinding where two polys share a vertex but have no portal.  Pathfinding will find a path but smoothing will fail (i think?).
Renderer is shared between asset manager and render system atm, may wkito to isolate it in one place.
changing camera view causes view to "shake"

NOTES

Should the forward method be a part of the view component? it seems tied to movement which isn't related to viewing
